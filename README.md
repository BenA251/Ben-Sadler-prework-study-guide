# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

I built this project to provide a pre work study guide on HTML, CSS, Javascript and Github to help prepare for skills bootcamp in front end web development. This makes revision of the key information easy and fun. During the process of putting the project together I was able to apply my learnings from pre work including create a HTML page which includes a interacting CSS style sheet and Javascript file.
